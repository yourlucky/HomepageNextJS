                    As the sole full-stack developer, I engineered a comprehensive Invoice Portal designed to automate
                    complex financial workflows. I led the entire development lifecycle, creating a system that
                    facilitates external invoice submissions while managing internal, role-based approval sequences. By
                    building a responsive front-end with Bootstrap and a robust back-end using Django and MySQL, I
                    delivered a seamless end-to-end user experience. <br /> <br /> The platform integrates real-time
                    payment monitoring, automated alerts, and budget aggregation tools to provide clear financial
                    oversight. This project generated $325K in annual cost savings and improved operational efficiency
                    by 0.75 hours daily for over 50 users, directly enhancing corporate budget control and team
                    productivity.
