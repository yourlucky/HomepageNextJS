                    As a founding member of the BuckyBots team, I led the software development for the Nao robot
                    platform from the ground up. To overcome the data scarcity and time constraints of physical robot
                    training, I engineered a high-speed simulation environment using PyGame. This Digital Twin approach
                    enabled data acquisition at 500 samples per second—roughly 2,500 times faster than physical
                    hardware—accelerating the development of robust reinforcementSim2Realreinforcement learning models.

                    <br />
                    My technical contributions spanned the entire robotics stack: utilizing OpenCV for real-time
                    perception of balls and field markers, implementing table-Baselines3 for behavioral planning, and
                    optimizing robot gait and control in C++based on the B-Human framework. These efforts culminated in
                    securing 3rd place in the Standard Platform League at RoboCup 2023 in France.

                    Explored the integration of hardware and cloud software through a custom IoT monitoring system. I
                    performed precision soldering and hardware integration for the BME280 sensor via I²C communication
                    on a Raspberry Pi. The system features a Python Flask backend that processes environmental data in
                    the cloud, providing a real-time web dashboard for monitoring room temperature and humidity
                    alongside personal schedule management. This project demonstrates my ability to bridge the gap
                    between physical sensors and web-based data visualization.
